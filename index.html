            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The reason why technology is important in education
                is that most of the jobs now have been interlinked with technology in some way.
                Learning by incorporating technology into education becomes important as it teaches
                students to learn basic technological skills, preparing them for future professional space.
                Using technology in education provides various tools to enhance a student's educational experience;
                one such tool is the use of pictures, videos, and sounds.
                Using an audio-visual medium of teaching enables students to not only learn but also understand what
                they are being taught better.
                Children have little span of attention and, as such, retaining their attention to studying
                becomes hard by traditional means as it can get repetitive and boring.
                Using something like technology that children often associate with fun can help retain their
                attention for a long time and help them learn better.
                Using technology for education gives access to a trove of unlimited information that is on the internet.
                Through the internet, students can satiate their curiosity as there is an unlimited amount of
                information
                through different sources that can answer almost any question.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology gives additional tools to teachers to explain a concept or a
                theory better through
                audiovisuals and through practical and live examples.
                Using technology in education also gives teachers access to more information that they then use to
                increase their own knowledge.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">With artificial intelligence, technology is increasingly involved in
                education. New digital competencies and media literacies call for a gender tra
                nsformative approach (promoting gender equality, sharing control of resources and decision-making, and
                women's empowerment in digitization and use of artificial intelligence (AI).
                Unlocking digital
                barriers through open educational resources enables global online learning and facilitate Education For
                All.

                Media and communication students would require ethics courses to establish their critical thinking
                skills and training.
                This is seen as being crucial in a ‘fake news’ era when trust in media professionals is being eroded,
                especially when news and documentary production is impacted by the capacity of artificial intelligence
                to manufacture authentic-looking
                ‘fake’ material. For instance, researchers at the University of Washington have created algorithms based
                on hours of video footage and
                audio recordings to create realistic lip-synced videos of Barack Obama.
